This manual is written by [Lim Jack Sheng](https://github.com/Jacksheng127), edited by by [Lim Jun Yi](https://github.com/LimJY03).

> In the workshop today, we will create a embed our Google Charts in the website.

You can alternatively refer to <!--[these videos]()--> and follow along at your own pace.

### Step 01: Download Relevant Files *(Optional)*

Download the sample website source code from [this repo](https://github.com/GCPE2023/DataVisualization). To download it, click on the green "Code" button and click "Download ZIP", or you can:

```sh
# Only if you have Git installed
git clone https://github.com/GCPE2023/DataVisualization.git
```

### Step 02: Open Receipts Data Google Sheets

Open your Receipts Data Google Sheets and paste the data from [this Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KslReSCAfiw4G2UqSPaeYqKIUWBT18Bx6hdT0uEBgeI/edit?usp=drivesdk) to your Google Sheets.

*If you don't have the Receipts Data Google Sheets, kindly create a new Google Sheets before doing the steps above.*

```diff

```

### Step 03: Creating Your First Line Chart

```diff
- Developing in progress ...
```

### Step 04: Creating Embed URL

Now, we change the `edit#` of the URL for the google sheet link with the following:

```
htmlembed/sheet?
```

And it should become something like:

* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EaAYaowfZzIWh3OvgvannRP5TnXGyBTvWrXJwBF-X_Q/**htmlembed/sheet?**gid=0

<!-- Then, we select a blank cell, donâ€™t double click it, just click 1 times on that empty cell, you will see a blue border around that cell

Now, we click on the chart and then "`CTRL + X`" (Windows OS) or "`CMD + X`" (Mac OS) or "`CUT`" to cut it out then paste it inside the blue border blank cell

So, this mean that we have successfully paste the chart inside that cell. -->

According to the blank cell that we just select, we can add the following at the end of the link:

```
&range=<YOUR_CELL_NUMBER>
```

And it should become something like:

* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EaAYaowfZzIWh3OvgvannRP5TnXGyBTvWrXJwBF-X_Q/htmlembed/sheet?gid=0**&range=c7**

### Step 05: Embedding Chart Using `<iframe>`

```diff
- Developing in progress ...
```

### Step 06: Clean Up

```diff
- Developing in progress ...
```

### Complete!

You have successfully visualize your receipt data with Google Charts and embedded it in your website.
